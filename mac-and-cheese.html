<p>I had just set my goals for the new year, vowing that I would be fit, and be sexier than ever, when I thought, "hmm... I want some mac and cheese." Arteries be damned. Ironically, my heart had never felt so light and free after I had 3 servings of this delicious macaroni and cheese. This is what Emelia Eirhardt must have felt like after she flew for the first time. Like Emelia, this mac and cheese is a big deal-ia.</p>
<p>Thinking of leaving your "comfort zone?" Don't. Sit back at home, and enjoy this creamy, crunchy velvetty macaroni and cheese. Trust me. I'm a scientist. </p></div>
